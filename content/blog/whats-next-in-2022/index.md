This year's goal is to **publish version 1.0** of the CSSUI.

In the latest release [v0.2.0]() we focused on **fixing some bugs** and **improved** several aspects of components **accessibility**.

In the meantime, we have established what the next new components will be to join the library:

1. **Carousel Slider**
2. **Progress bar**

We are reflecting on the **Datepicker**, given the more complex operation that may require Javascript for some functionality.

If you have any suggestion, please [raise a request](https://github.com/zetareticoli/cssui/issues) on Github. 👍

**Our goal remains to add CSS only components.** 🦾

We also plan to **add Sass files** for each component so as to allow better integration with projects that make use of the compiler to generate CSS.

Thank you 🙏
